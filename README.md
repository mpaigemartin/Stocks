# Stocks

In this homework, I attempted to use an outlining API to create a website that renders stock information about a users prefered stocks, and saves them as buttons to the page. I started out with three stocks I found interesting, Apple, Tesla, and Amazon, and displayed their company names, logos, latest stock price, and a few articles that can be found about the company.
